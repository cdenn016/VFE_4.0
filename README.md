# VFE 4.0

This repository implements the bounded H1 foundation for a deterministic,
evaluation-only VFE 4.0 verification run. H1 is the only implemented gate.

The user-facing surface is `verify_vfe4.py`. Its top-level `CONFIG` dictionary
is editable, and the file can be run directly from an IDE or file association;
there are no command-line flags or parser. Importing it performs no work.

H1 evaluates one frozen `T=2`, scalar-state, scalar-model fixture in three
separately assembled ways:

1. a monolithic full-joint Gaussian-mixture ELBO;
2. a local conditional-factor ELBO decomposition; and
3. an independent NumPy evidence-minus-posterior-KL identity.

At reviewed revision `b736d21`, all three values are approximately
`-3.911522906174741`. The maximum pairwise residual is
`4.440892098500626e-16`; the largest pair-specific allowance is
`7.582209551464146e-13`. Every pair and every homologous local term is decided
against its own calibrated allowance. The exact-head click-run gate reports
`H1: pass` and publishes an atomic, manifest-checked artifact under `runs/`.

There is no dataset, language-model training path, optimizer, parameter update,
or gradient calculation in H1. This bounded evaluation performs no
backpropagation, but the VFE 4.0 codebase is not claimed to be
backpropagation-free. H2 through H8 remain unimplemented.
